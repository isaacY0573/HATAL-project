Video Processing Tool
This project is a video processing tool that allows users to apply various operations on videos, including trimming, rotating, resizing, adding filters, and overlaying text. The project uses OpenCV to handle video processing tasks, and it supports saving the processed video in a new format.

Features:
1. Trim video based on start and end time
2. Rotate video by 90°, 180°, or 270°
3. Resize video to specified dimensions
4. Apply filters like grayscale or blur
5. Add custom text to video frames
6. Save processed video in .avi format



Installation:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:

C++ Compiler: Any modern C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
OpenCV Library: Install OpenCV version 4.x or later
Install OpenCV


Windows:

Download OpenCV from the official OpenCV website.

Add the OpenCV binaries to your system path.



Example

When you run the application, you will be prompted to enter the video file path and several options for processing the video. For example:

Enter video file path: input_video.mp4
Enter output file path: output_video.avi
Choose processing options: You will be given a menu to select from trimming, rotating, resizing, applying filters, or adding text.
Select filter or transformation: Based on your choice, provide additional input such as the rotation angle, text, or filter option.
The processed video will be saved at the specified output path.

Keyboard Controls:
Press q during playback to exit the application.

by the way: just to mention that i had a stressful time lately, so if i had the time im sure this project would be alot better...
